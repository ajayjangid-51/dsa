// as per the Concept_of_multiprogramming, multiprogramming says that ki ram meh jitni jda no.of-processes hogi then utna hi jda cpu-utilization hoga. and degree-of-multiprogramming ka mtlb ram k ander kitne no.-of-processes hai.

// so toh mtlb as per multiprogramming, the degree-of-multiprogramming should be high, and this can only be achieved by mapping the more number-of-processes into the ram. So toh now mtlb apn yehi dekhenge ki apn ram meh jda-se-jda no.of-processes kaise daal sktehh hai, and esi kaam ko krne ko simply memory-manage krna khtehh hai.
// so toh Mtlb yaha apn memory-manage krne k methods mtlb ram-memory meh more-and-more no.of-processes daalne k methods ko dekhenge..
// Main goal of memory-management is ki utilize the memory more and more efficiently so that cpu-utilization can be increased.

// notepoint:-
// 1.ram-memory ka "primary-memory" naam with respect to cpu pdaa hai.. As q ki cpu k sbse karib Ram-memory hi hoti hai. Cache-memory and resistor-memory k alava.
// 2.Degree of multiprogramming ka mtlb hai ki amount of processes or mtlb amount of programs present or pushed into ram-memory.
// 3.Toh mtlb if degree of multiprogramming is high cpu-working will also be high mtlb cpu ko wait nhi krna hoga for the processes to first come in ram and then execution will start.
