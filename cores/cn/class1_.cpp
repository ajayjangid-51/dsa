// now a days kisi bhi Computer-Network meh 7 layers hoti hai, ya layers se accha simply basically apn yeh bol sktehh hai ki 7 branches ya mtlb "steps" hoti hai, har har branch ka Computer-Network meh apna-apna role hota hai for making the successful/errorless Network by which then we can Communicate over the network(cn meh network mtlb always it is Computer-Network only).
//
// yaha "network" ka mtlb ki communication( ya mtlb information exchange krne k liyeh) krne k liyeh jobhi physical and logical apnko krni pdti hai uss sare taam-jaam ko apn network boltehh hai jaise. and phir jaise mtlb agr apn yeh sara taam-jaam computers ko communicate krwane k liyeh kr rhe hai then uss netwrok ko apn "computer-network" boltehh hai and esi tarah other network hotehh hai.

// jaise physical-branch ka role hota hai for making/establishing physical-path or medium for travelling of communication-data over the all network.
// Network ko apn as a Graph ki terms meh bhi dekh sktehh hai, where "computers" of network are as a "nodes" in a Graph and physical-path or medium(which can be wired or wireless) of the network is as a "edges or links" in the Graph.
