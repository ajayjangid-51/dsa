// defination of softwareEngineering is ki it is  technique or mtlb it is a engineering-approach for developing a software in systematic-manner,cost-effective-manner(mtlb money and time is important resources) and in disciplined-manner(mtlb serious and regurlarly manner meh kaam krna hai).

// 1.whereas "technique" mtlb "koi ek tarika of doing some work, mtlb uss kisi particular work se related/dedicated tarike ko apn simply techique boltehh hai, and yaha related/dedicated ka mtlb ki yeh tarika/method sirf usi kaam k liyeh hai, that-is-why we are calling this tarika as technique."
//  thus toh allover "technique" mtlb "kisi-particular-ek-kaam-ko-krne-ka-ekdum-dedicated-tarika".
//  2."engineering-approach" mtlb a systematic-approach to solve the problem, mtlb it consists-of-6-steps:- 1.idea , 2.concept, 3.planning, 4.design, 5.development ,6.testing, 7. and launch and then again 8.feedback and 9.performing cycle of all these things.
// jaise for.eg:- ki jaise branded-companies toh apne products ko engineering-approach se banati hai and jaise yeh local-mechanics apne products ko kisi bhi approach(mainly build-and-launch mtlb no testing, no planning , no feedback etc..etc.. very much more khamiya in the product-development) se bana detehh hai. and eska farak products meh apnko saaf-saaf dikhta hai, mtlb jaise. mahindra-ki-major and local-garage-meh-bhi-major meh bohat farak hota hai.

// toh mtlb softwareEngineering only how-to-code-a-software se related nhi hai, actually yeh overall how to develop-a-software se related hai sare one-by-one in series Steps.

// software-crisis mtlb software-संकट , mtlb in 1965-85 meh jo bhi softwares bn rhe the voh sab simple build-and-deliver_approach se bn rhe the, thus toh eski vajah se software-pe-संकट aagaya, mtlb bohat sare software-development meh money and time ki kami aagyi jiski vajah se voh sahi se bn hi nhi payeh, and jaise jo software bn toh gayeh , but unki sahi tarah se testing nhi hone ki vajah se voh bich meh hi thuff hojatehh the etc..etc.. mtlb it is like 100-softwares meh se 2-hi software ko sahi thik-thak tarike se use ho pa rhe the..
// best-example of software-developement-failure is os-360 operating-software developed by IBM, and head of IBM himself said that it was a multi-millions-failure-project. and this is only bcoz of not following the engineering-approach for developing software.
// so toh mtlb if we follow softwareEngineering then there is high-probability ki apna software successfully develop hohi jayega.

// word-power:-
// 1.scrap mtlb "रद्दी माल".
