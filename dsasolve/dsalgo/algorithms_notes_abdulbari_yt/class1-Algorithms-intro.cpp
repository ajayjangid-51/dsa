// AS NOW YAHA pe apn Algorithms k bareh meh dekhenge....
// As Algorithm ka mtlb hota hai ek tarika , ek approach , ek line-of-steps think to do that koi particular taskk...
// thus toh now apn YAha pe voh kuch diff-diff tarike , approachs dekhenge for doing for solving kuch particular type ki problems..
// (vase problem naam ki koi cheez hoti hi nhi hai... as actually mtlb solution hota hai.. pr log usko problem bolteh hai , toh koi nhi apn toh usko solution bolteh hai.. mtlb ek-do tarike sikh lenge .. and voh uska solution apnko mil jayega, mtlb voh uska solution hojayega.. simple .. )

// diff betwenn algorithm and program:
// ðŸŽ† according to Software-development-cycle ðŸŽ†
// and main important steps in that cycle is design and implementation of the progam. where designing-part-of-program is known as algorithm. and implementation part is known as Code-of-the program.
// as alogrithm toh apna idea+then uss idea ko krne ka tarika + then uss tarike ko apni own language meh write krne ka tarika..
// and program is implementation of that Algorithm in the code.

// as algorithm "a person having domain-knowledge can write or that will suggest the algorithm-steps to be  follow to be taken. "  as algorithm meh sirf only domain-knowledge se kaam nhi hota , as q ki algorithm apni puri own-language meh nhi hota. as algorithm ko mltb uss domain-knowledge ko writing-code ki terms meh likha jata hai. takki mtlb actual-code(mtlb program) likhteh time easily , errolessly apn actual-code ko likh payeh , implement kr payeh. (alogithm is not dependent on hardware or opeartin-system. but program depends)
// and program is written by programmer .

// software-life-cycle:- (as mtlb software k peda hone se software k marne tk ka time is known as software-life and apn "cycle" ka use isiliy kr rahe hai q ki software kabhi marta nhi hai mtlb voh update hota rheta hai mtlb re-new with exists + more features. )
// as software k pade hone k liyeh 2-cheeze hoti hai:- 1st:- designing(exact and correct as mtlb "algorithm" is there in designing) and 2nd:- is implementation( as mtlb "code" is there ). as implementation-complete hone k baad software peda ho jata hai.
//

// difference between algorithm and Program:
//              (Algorithm)                                (Program)
//             comes at design-time               comes at implementation-time
//             person with domain-knowledge         written by programmer
//              written in any laguage               written in specific language
//              Hardware and Os independent(means-          performance depend on hardware and os
//              it does not considered any hardware
//              and Os.
//                  Analyze                                     directly testing.
// as toh algorithm most probably and mostly C-language meh likha jata hai as writing in any-other language like our-own-comman-language etc..etc.. and eska ek fayadee ek orr bhi hai ki apn phir alogrithm ko simply dekh kr easily program ko implement kr skteh hai in our favourite-language.
