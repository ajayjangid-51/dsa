//🔥💲🍕 Frequency-Count-Method for finding the time-complexity 🍕💲🔥
// Now apn yeh dekhenge ki apn kisi Algorithm pe yeh method lagake kaise time-complexity find krenge...

// As ess method meh apn sirf simply statements ki frequency count krteh hai mtlb ki statements kitme baar execute ho rahi hai voh find krteh hai. As thus toh vohi apni time-complexity equation hogi and apn simply uss equation se time-complexity-notation find krlenge , as time-complexity equation meh nhi as voh hamesa notation meh mention hoti hai. As apnko ek bas pata hona chahiyeh ki yeh itna lg-bhg  hota hai mtlb apnko exact time janneh ki jarurat nhi hai...
// And as space-complexity meh apn jaiseh time-complexity meh simple-statement ko 1-unit-time consider krteh the.. as same vasehi apn space-complexity meh simple-container-of-any-datatype ko 1-unit-space deteh hai.. toh bas apn simply phir allover space calculate kr leteh hai..

// Apn ek baat note krenge ki jaise loop meh ek-contianer jo hota hai , har baar voh container hi use hota hai toh mtlb loop meh uss container ki space-complexity 1 hi hai naki "n" hai.. as agr loop meh har baar koi heap meh alg-alg memory allocate ho rhi hai. Then tab toh space-complexity order-of "n" hogi. Thus toh mtlb space-complexity k liyeh apnko yeh baateh dhyn meh rkhni hai hamesa..
