//🔥💲🍕 AS NOW YAHA pe apn all general-time-functions of the program ko Comapare krna dekhenge ki mtlb ki "programming" meh kis basis functions ko compare kiya jata hai, as q ki "programming" meh actual mathematics se thoda diff tarike se "Functions" ko compare kiya jata hai, as q ki programming meh uss tarike se apn comare krtehh hai toh mtlb apni "programming" easily ho jati hai. ... 🍕💲🔥
// and acchi baat boleh toh ki "programming" meh functions ko compare krne ka ek ek-dam aasaan tarika hai, and voh yeh hai ki apnko phle simply given "functions" ka "Order( mtlb "degree" )" nikal lena hai and then for very "high-values" ko liyeh unn simple-Ordered or mtlb degree-extracted-functions ko compare kr lena hai, and phir jo result apnko milta hai, vohi result apnko dhyn rkna hai and uske according hi phir aage kaam krna hai.

// As comparing meh apnko choti values k liyeh compare nhi krna.. apnko toh badi-high values k liyeh compare krna hai, bcoz yahi sahi tarika hai for choosing the the right-algorithm as q ki choti-values k liyeh toh dono algo meh koi farak nhi padta for the time-taken of program but badi values k liyeh farak pdta hai, and other reason yeh bhi hai apne program k user dheere-dheere scale hi honge toh eske basis pe bhi apn badi-values k hi liyeh check krteh hai while comparison...

// 🔗 refer to pic1(as these are possible orders-of Functions and these are arranged in increading order of their values for same input-of-high-values ):- As apnko bina soche-samje esske according Algorithms ko compare kr lena hai agr apn time-taken-by-algorithm k liyeh compare kr rhe hao toh. 🔔 As yeh order high-big-values k basis pe hi hai... 🔗
