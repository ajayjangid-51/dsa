// 🍧🍧 priori-analysis and 🍧🍧posteriori-testing 🍧🍧
// Yeh do terms hoti hai in the software-development-life-span. 
// As priori-analysis mtlb Algorithm ka Analysis krna and posteriori mtlb Algorithm se jo apnne program banaya na uski testing krna.
// As toh apn ek baat note-krenge ki kisi ek kaam ka priori-analysis-result bhi hota hai and posterio-testing-result bhi hota hai. As dono result hi use ho sktehh hai for analyizing ki ess kaam ko krne k liyeh yeh Algorithm accha hai ya nhi hai. 
// As but baat yeh hai ki enn dono meh thoda-bohat diff ho skta hai.. q ki priori-analysis-result toh machine-independent hota hai, and time and space-complexitIes as a function hoti hai mtlb exact-value nhi hoti , but on otherhand posterio-testing-result toh machine-depnedent bhi hota hai and time and space-complexitIes as a exact value hoti hai..
// And also language dependent and independent respectively.



// prior-Analysis and Posteriori-Testing:
// as algorithms k liyeh prior-analysis mtlb in the sense of program-implementation se phle analysis where ess analysis krne ka yahi faydaa hota hai ki apn analysis meh banne wale program ki time and space-complexity mtlb time and space-function in terms of the input-size find-out krteh hai.

//  and program k liyeh posteriori(mtlb baad-meh)-testig hoti hai mtlb apn ek baar program banane k baad meh phir uski testing krteh hai (as esliy we are saying posteriori-testing) and uss testing meh apn apn program ko run krteh hai and vaha uss program ka run-time and Bytes-consumed find-out krteh hai. and yeh runtime and bytes-consumed mostly prior-analysis k same-same hi hota hai.
