//🔥💲🍕 Greedy-method or Greedy-statergy or Greedy-Approach to solve a Particular-type-of-Problems:- 🍕💲🔥
// As we know that ki yeh approach optimization-problem ko solve krne k liyeh hoti hai, where optimization is  about the getting maximum-result or minimum-result

//👿📔imp-Note-point:- 🌟🌟🌟  Programming-implementation meh apn jo actully think krtehh hai na apn actully usi thinking ko extract krna chahtehh hai mtlb usiko extract krtehh hai.. thus toh yaha jo algo-approaches apn dekh rhe hai na voh actully yehi apni thinking ka extact krke hi yeh topics bane hai.. 🌟🌟🌟

// optimization-problem meh jo optimal-solution hota hai voh actully applied conditions k basis pe hota hai, jaise:- apnko A-to-B jana hai, and apnko A to B within 12-hours meh jana and minimum-cost meh bhi jana hai. Thus toh mtlb yaha phir optimal-solution is that ki apn "train" se chale jayehh

// Thus toh greedy-approach ki jaise apn solution-space meh sirf only feasible-solution nikalna or ya consider krna. Mtlb jaise apnko 12hours se phle puchna hai, toh mtlb apn 12hours se kaam time lene wali cheez ko hi dekhenge.. Thus toh allover greedy-approach krna mtlb apnko jo chahiyeh bas exactly vohi krna jaise apnko minimum chahiyeh toh apn hamesa minimum-most ko hi consider krna and agr maximum chahiyeh toh apn hamesa maximum-mosts ko hi consider krenge..

//📔📔Note-point:- The solutions which satisfy the condition or obey the condition are known to be as feasible-solutions..
//📔📔Note-point:- There can be multiple solutions, there can be multiple feasible solutions but there will be only one optimal-solution

//Optimization-problem voh problem hoti hai jismeh apnko minimum or ya maximum result chahiyeh hota hai....

//🖼️🖼️🖼️  see pic-3 for seeing this thing ki apn "Optimization-Problem" ko enn 3-Statergies se solve kr sktehh hai, or ya mtlb apn esseh bhi samaj sktehh hai ki "Greedy" , "DP( Dynamic-programming) " and "BB(Branch and Bound)"-approches or methods apn "Optimization-problem" ko solve krne k liyeh use krtehh hai. 🖼️🖼️🖼️

//🔔🔔 General-form or General-method-of-implementation of Greedy-approach is this in pic4.  🔔🔔
//🖼️🖼️🖼️  see pic-4 :- for this..🖼️🖼️🖼️
// AS So toh according toh Greedy-approaches-implementation A problem should be solved in stages and in each stage we will consider or take one-input and checking it for that it is feasible or not and if feasible then we will include that in our solution and then again repeating this. As yeh wali baat Algorithm-implement krne ki terms hai, as esseh toh apn samaj gayehh ki greedy kya hoti hai and kaise hoti hai .and bas baat hai implementation ki , kii ess method ko apn code kaise krenge thus toh code apn esko ess tarah se krenge.. jo ki abhi apnne upar bola hai..

//🔔🔔 👿📔imp-Note-point:-Greedy-approach mtlb simply apne faydee k liyeh jo apn krtehh hai use Greedy-statergy se krna boltehh hai. And apna fayedaa kha hai? As apna fayeda toh problem-objective fullfilment meh hai..
// Apne fayedee k liyeh krna is known to be greedy-krna,greedy se krna..
// And yaha programming meh apna fayedaa ,jo problem ka objective hota hai vohi hi apna fayedaa hota hai..
// And ek baat aur ki greedy meh filtration obey hota hai.. mtlb apn har baar solution-space meh se feasible-solution find krteh jatehh hai, krtehh hai jatehh hai by imposing the constraints or conditions of the problem on the solution-space and last meh apnko apna "optimal-solution" mil jata hai, but yeh jo filtration apn krtehh hai, yeh apnko greedily krna hota hai, as tabhi yeh "greedy"-method khelati hai.  🔔🔔
