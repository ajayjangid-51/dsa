// diff betwenn algorithm and program:
// ðŸŽ† according to Software-development-cycle ðŸŽ†
// and main important steps in that cycle is design and implementation of the progam. where designing-part-of-program is known as algorithm. and implementation part is known as Code-of-the program.
// as alogrithm toh apna idea+then uss idea ko krne ka tarika + then uss tarike ko apni own language meh write krne ka tarika..
// and program is implementation of that Algorithm in the code.

// as algorithm "a person having domain-knowledge can write or that will suggest the algorithm-steps to be  follow to be taken. "  as algorithm meh sirf only domain-knowledge se kaam nhi hota , as q ki algorithm apni puri own-language meh nhi hota. as algorithm ko mltb uss domain-knowledge ko writing-code ki terms meh likha jata hai. takki mtlb actual-code(mtlb program) likhteh time easily , errolessly apn actual-code ko likh payeh , implement kr payeh. (alogithm is not dependent on hardware or opeartin-system. but program depends)
// and program is written by programmer .

// ðŸŽ† class-2 ðŸŽ†
// prior-Analysis and Posteriori-Testing:
// as algorithms k liyeh prior-analysis mtlb in the sense of program-implementation se phle analysis where ess analysis krne ka yahi faydaa hota hai ki apn analysis meh banne wale program ki time and space-complexity mtlb time and space-function in terms of the input-size find-out krteh hai.

//  and program k liyeh posteriori(mtlb baad-meh)-testig hoti hai mtlb apn ek baar program banane k baad meh phir uski testing krteh hai (as esliy we are saying posteriori-testing) and uss testing meh apn apn program ko run krteh hai and vaha uss program ka run-time and Bytes-consumed find-out krteh hai. and yeh runtime and bytes-consumed mostly prior-analysis k same-same hi hota hai.
