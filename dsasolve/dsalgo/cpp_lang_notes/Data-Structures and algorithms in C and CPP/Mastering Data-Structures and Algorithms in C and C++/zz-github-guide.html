// as github pe apn apna code-host krteh hai takki apn apne code ka version-tracked rahe and koi orr bhi aake apne saat apne code k liyeh collaborate kr sake. mtlb apn and others (from anywhere from the entire-earth) ess mere project pe ek saat kaam kr sake.
/* yaha pe apn github pe repository,branches , commits and pull requests k bareh meh dekhenge::

// As Readme-file meh software or project ki information  hoti hai.
// As Branching mtlb apn branching se apn apne project k different versions or mtlb diff-copy bana skteh hai and unpeh phir kaam kr skteh hai.. ya krva skteh hai.
// as apn branch ko experiment krne k liyeh hi banateh hai, mtlb apn directly main-app meh changes nhi krteh , mtlb uski copy(mtlb branch) bana krke usmeh changement , add krteh hai and then afterall-uss copy meh main-copy meh merge kr deteh hai..
// As by-default toh apni repo ki ek hi branch hoti hai and that is named as “main”-branch..
note-point: as repository-owner hi sirf apni repository k braches bana skta hai..
// as toh apn apne app ya mtlb apne project ki branches create krke mtlb copies create krke unn copies pe kaam kr skteh hai ya krva skteh hai and then phir unn copies ko testing krke unn copy ko apni actual-original-copy meh pull-in kr skteh hai mtlb merge kr skteh hai.
// As apn branches ka use for experiment krne k liyeh krteh hai, developing krne krteh hai, and ek baar experiment and develop krne k baad phir usseh commit kr deteh hai mtlb main-branch bana deteh hai uss particular branch ko. As toh voh branch toh nikal jati hai and main-branch update or mtlb upgrade ho jati hai uss commited-wali branch se..
// As main-branch ko hi master-branch khteh hai.. and copy-branch-of-master-branch ko feature-branch khteh hai..
// As now apn readme-edits newly created feature-branch ko meh kuch add krnege ,update krnege and the useh commit kr denge mtlb main-branch meh merge kr denge. Ya main-branch k respect meh feature-branch ko pull-in kr lenge..
// Commit mtlb changes-saved!
// As har commit k saat ek commit message bhi hota hai where usmeh apn apne made  changes k bareh meh likhteh hai.. ki yeh changes kya hai and q kiyeh gayeh hai..
// Pull-requests mtlb apne pass request aayi hai ki aap meri ess feature-branch ko apne main-branch meh pull krlo..
// As branch-mtlb apne project-folder ki copy hi.
// As feature meh updation krke apnne feature-branch ko commit kiya hai. Toh mtlb appne made changes ko save kr liya hai.. but voh abhi tk main-branch meh pull nhi huaa hai, thus toh main-branch meh pull krne k liyeh apnko pull-request daalni pdti hai. As toh apn pull-request daal deteh hai..
// Now owner of repository pull-request check krta hai and then voh feature-branch ko dekhta hai and agr voh sahi hai then usseh apni main-branch meh merge kr leta hai..
// As owner ko pull-request sare changes dikhteh hai. In green and red. Where addition toh green meh dikhaee deta hai and substaction red meh dikhaee deta hai..
// As pull feature-branch-developer k respect meh hota hai ki aap owner of the repo esko pull kr ligiyeh. And yahi cheez open-source-contribution khlati hai. 
-->
<!-- And merge with respect ko owner hota hai ki voh own pull request or mtlb pull-in request ko apne main-branch mtlb main-folder meh “merge” kr leta hai..

:use this command to clone(or mtlb make-copy) git-repository: git clone https://github.com/AjayJangid511/hello-world..
// forking or importing ek hi baat hai..

// As mtlb jo bhi public-repo hai. Voh open-source hai.
// thus toh yaha pe apn helloworld-repo banyenge and pull-rewu
*/
// or for shortly just follow these steps:
// step1: go to github.com and signin into it >> click on the "new"- to create new-repository and set all the general-properties associate with our project. like project public , etc..etc..
// step2: go to our project-folder in our pc >> open git-bash for that folder >> command "git init" >>

// 🎆 difference between fork and clone: 🎆
// as fork se toh apn kisi git-repo apne accout ki git-repo bana skteh hai.. mtlb fork krne se voh git-repo apne pc meh nahi copy hogi. as fork krne ka mtlb apn kisi orr ki git-repo ko apni repo bana rahe hai. and then baad meh apn uss forked-repo ko clone kr skteh hai ya phir directly uss actual-user's-repo ko clone kr skteh hai..
// and clone ka mtlb hai ki apn git-repo ko apne apni personal-pc meh copy kr rahe hai.

//  as initial-commit meh apn commits-related bateh dekhteh hai , ki kitne , konse commit kiyeh gayeh hai and q kiyeh gayeh hai..

// okay and commit krne se request bhi bhej de jati hai, where , phir then user request ko pull krke mtlb change ko pull krke apne main-copy meh merge kr lega hai. after comparing agr usseh sahi lageh toh , otherwise nhi krta..
// pull-request mtlb pull-krne ki request which is made from the contributor.
// and pull request with respect to owner ki ess pull-request ko pull krna and then merge krna..
// as github pe pull-request as like likes or hearts ki tarah hoti hai , ki haan koi hai jisseh apne project meh interest hai.. and useh contribute kiya bhi hai.
// as overall mtlb apn phle git-repo ko clone krteh hai , then usmeh changes krke baad meh  pull-request-option pe jake ya directly bhi comparison krke pull-request daal skteh hai , creat kr skteh hai.. -->
