// Some other Datatypes(mtlb some other Types of Data) k liyeh Containers dekhenge:
// AS now YAHA Pe apn Pointers k bareh meh dekhenge:
// As Pointers bhi simply ek Datatype(mtlb ek Type of data mtlb pointer-data) k liyeh Containers hi hoteh hai. as mtlb enn Pointer-Container meh "memory-container-Address-type-of-data" store hota hai. as yeh memory-container-Address bhi ek type ka data hota hai , as but yeh integer , float etc.. data jaisa nhi hota. jisko simply pointer bola jata hai.

// ğŸŒŸPointer or reference ka mtlb ek hi hai mtlb dono ka mtlb address hi hota hai.. jaise a ka reference mtlb a ka address. jaise "a" ka rederence dena mtlb "a" ka address dena.
