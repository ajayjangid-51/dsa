// YAHA pe apn C++ meh sare sabhi Reserved-keywords dekhenge and one-by-one unka use bhi dekhenge.
// As Reserved-Keywords simply boleh toh ek function(can be called by name only) ki tarah hi hoteh hai jo ki kuch kaam krteh mtlb instructions deteh hai kisi kaam ko hone k liyeh mtlb yeh keywords Compiler ko compilation k time kuch instruction deteh hai with related to memory-allotment-for-datas and execution-cursor ko program runtime pe kuch instruction dete hai just jumping from one place to other or mtlb kuch bhi accordingly:
// ðŸŽ† Thus allover apn esseh bol skteh hai ki Reserved-keywords two types k hoteh hai:
// 1.compiler-dedicated (mtlb kuch or mostly keywords compiler ko instruction dene k liyeh hoteh hai) jaise: int , float , bool , long , signed , unsigned , etc..etc memory-allotment k liyeh hoteh hai. and many more
// 2.execution-cursor-dedicated (mtlb kuch keywords execution-cursor ko instruction deteh hai mtlb dene k liyeh hoteh hai.) jaise: for , while etc.. yeh saab execution-cursor k liyeh hoteh hai and phir enn keywords k accordingly execution-cursor repectively behave krta hai.

// ðŸ””Tip: as C++ -language meh overall 95-keywords hai jinmeh 30 toh common hai mtlb C-language k 30 keywords hai and 32 and 33 keywords ek dam new hai from C-language
// as reserved-words or simply boleh toh "keywords" voh words hoteh hai jinseh compiler ko kuch instruction milti , control-cursor ko instructions milti hai. and kuch others bhi .
// thus toh apn esseh bhi bol skteh hai ki compiler k liyeh alag reserved-keywords hoteh hai , control-cursor k liyeh alag keywords hoteh hai.

// ðŸ““note-point: AS apn enn Keywords ko kisi variable , function  , class , object , struct , union etc k identifier k liyeh use nhi kr skteh , as bcoz phir compiler and execution-cursor nhi samaj payegana ki yeh mtlb kya ho raha hai , thus isiliy apni IDE apnko phle hi error warn kr deti hai.

// and orr toh orr reserved-keywords ko reserved esliy bola jata hai as q ki voh words reserved hai , thus mtlb apn enn keywords ko koi as a identifier for variable , function , class etc k liyeh use nhi kr skteh hai.  mtlb "reserved-keywords" are reserved from using as a identifier. bcoz reserved-keywords compiler , control-cursor ko instructions dene k liyeh hoteh hai ya phir kuch denote krne k liyeh hoteh hai.
