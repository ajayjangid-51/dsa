Diff -between Programming-language and scripting-language:

As
 Programming-language ka code compiler k duvra
 high-level-language se machine-level-instructions meh covert
 kiya jata hai.. 
And scripting-language ka code intrepeter se
 high-level-language-instructions se
 machine-level-instructions meh covert kiya jata hai..

As mtlb 
compiler toh pure-code ko ek baar meh analaze krke ek saat meh
 hi machine-level-instructions meh convert kr deta hai.
 But intrepeter ek-ek statement ko analyize and saat meh 
machine-leve-instructions meh convert krta hai..

As toh esseh 
compiler jada time consume krta hai and intrepeter kaam time 
consume krta hai for converting into 
machine-level-instructions meh. 

As but compiled kiya gaya 
program fast run hota hai and intrepeted kiya gaya program 
thoda slow run hota hai..

Jaise
 Javascript , python scripting-language hai and
 jaise C , C++ Programming-languauge hai.


Note-point: as scripting-language bhi Programming-language hi
hai..

As scripting-language websites , web-apps k liyeh bohat
 sahi hai for loading and reload fns...
