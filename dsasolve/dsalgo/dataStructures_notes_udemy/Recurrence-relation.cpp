//🔥💲🍕 Recurrence-Relation:- 🍕💲🔥
// 🔗 see pic1. 🔗

// As recursion ko apn two way meh trace kr sktehh hai...
// 1.tree-form which is called tree-tracing
// 2.stack-form which is called stack-tracing

// Dono hi sahi hai.. as bas tree -tracing easy and fast hai..

// As agr apne pass recursion(mtlb recursive-function) ka recurrence-relation hai then toh phir mtlb apn easily uss recurrence-relation se uss recursion-fn ki time-complexity easily findout kr sktehh hai..
// Substitution mtlb ek cheez ko hata k usski jagah koi kisi dusri cheez ko rkhnaa..

// As toh recurrence relation ki main application yehi hai ki apn easily recursiion-functions ki time-complexity find kr skyehh hai..
