//ğŸ”¥ğŸ’² AS NOW YAHA pe apn "Strict-binary-tree" and "complete-binary-tree" meh diffrence dekhenge. as apn phle se hi janteh hai ki "Strict-binary-tree" and "Complete-binary-tree" kya hota hai, but now apn enmeh difference dekhenge ki mtlb yeh dono ek dusre kaise or kitne alag hai.ğŸ’²ğŸ”¥

//ğŸ””ğŸ”” as apn ek baat note krenge ki kabhi-kabhi "strict-binary-tree" ko "complete-binary-tree" bhi bol diya jata hai but yaha "complete ka mtlb complete-binary-tree" nhi hai as yeh toh esseh hi "complete" bol diya jata hai. and agr esseh kuch hai then apn uss "complete-binary-tree" ko "almost-complete-binary-tree" bolteh hai, thus toh apnko yeh wali baat acchse dhyn meh rkhni hai.  ğŸ””ğŸ””

// As toh apnne 3-4 examples dekhenge and unko apnne conclude kiya ki koi binary-tree toh strict hai but complete nhi hai , and koi strict-bhi-hai and complete-bhi-hai, and koi strict-nhi-hai but complete-hai , and strict-bhi-nhi hai and complete-bhi-nhi hai. then mtlb yeh for all-the-examples yeh 4-bateh hi hogi.esseh kuch toh allover apn yeh conclude kr sktehh hai ki apn upar-wali naming hi use krenge mtlb strict-binary-tree ko "strict-binary-tree" hi bolenge and "complete-binary-tree" ko "complet-binary-tree" hi bolenge q ki apnne abhi upare examples se conclude kr liya hai ki yeh "naming" hi sahi hai.

//ğŸ“”ğŸ“”Note-point:- as "Complete-binary-tree" kafi important hai, mtlb agr apnko kisi "binary-tree" ko array meh represent krna ho mtlb array-ds meh tree-ds ko allocate krna ho then vaha pe phle apne "binary-tree" k about conformation honi chahiyeh ki yeh "binary-tree" "complete-binary-tree" hai ya nhi hai and agr "complete-binary-tree" hai then tab toh apn esko "array" meh represent kr sktehh hai but agr voh "complete-binary-tree" nhi hai then apn usko array meh represent nhi krenge q ki voh phir afordable nhi hai q ki apnko aage phir orr orr jada kaam krna pdta hai for finding the gaps in the array and phir unn gaps ko apnnko handle krna etc.etc.. voh sab apnko faltu meh krna pdta for representing the "in-complete-binary-tree" in "array".
