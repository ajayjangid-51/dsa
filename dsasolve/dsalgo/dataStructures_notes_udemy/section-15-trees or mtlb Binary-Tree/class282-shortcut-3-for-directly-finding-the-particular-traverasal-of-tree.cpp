//🔥💲🍕 Method-3:- 🍕💲🔥
// As toh ess Method meh apnko as like Method1 , Method2 ki tarah vase voh kuch drawing vagera nhi krni apn directly traversing-answer bata payenge..
// As but yeh method same as it method2 ki tarah hai bas esmeh apn kuch drawing nhi krteh , as apn simply vaha hypen-line-mark ki jagah apni finger ko point krvateh on the left-side-of-all-nodes(for pre-order-traversing) , bottom-side-of-all-nodes(or in-order-traversing) and right-side-of-all-nodes(for post-order-traversing). and afterthat apnko simply from "root"-node tree-ki-boundary k along apne hand ko move krna hota hai and rasteh meh jo bhi node aayeh jisko apni finger uske towards point kr rahi ho uss node ko apnko apne traversing-result meh likh lena hai.
// thus toh ess Method k according apnko simply kuch nhi k

//👿📔imp-Note-point:- one-point to noted that ki first-element of pre-order-traversal-result is always to equal to last-element-of-post-order-traversal-result

//🔔🔔 AS toh now aab apn aage enn Traversal ko krne k programm likhenge mtlb enn Traversal-tariko ko programatically implement krenge mtlb Traversing krne ka program banayenge... as apne pass logic toh hai, bas usko progrmatically implement krna hai, takki apna program ban jayehh.. 🔔🔔

//🌟🌟🌟  So always follow this shortcut-Method3 for finding the "preorder" , "inorder" and "postorder" 🌟🌟🌟
