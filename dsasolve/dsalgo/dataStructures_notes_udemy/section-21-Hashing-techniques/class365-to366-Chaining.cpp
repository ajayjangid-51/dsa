//🔥💲🍕 chaining-Method 🍕💲🔥
// As chaining-method is based on open-hashing... mtlb esseh apn defined-hash-table k alava kuch extra-space use krenge...

//👿📔imp-Note-point:-as enn sbhi Collision-Resolving-Techniques meh apnko sirf mainly yeh 3-cheeze hi dekhni hai. as yehi important and apn yehi acche se dekhenge...
// 1.insertion (that how to insert an Element in the hash-table mtlb where to store the element and how and inwhich manner it should be stored at that.)
// 2.searching- and its working-analysis mtlb its time-analysis (as bcoz time-depends on working )
// as analysis hi important hai , as apn sab kuch eske liyeh hi kr rhe hai.), (as Searching mtlb apnko searching kaise krni hai..etc..etc. mtlb kab apna succesffull-search hoga and kab-unsuccesffull-search hoga etc..etc...)
// 3.deletion. (how to delete the element from the hash-table as if element-deletion-is-requested and mtlb kya-kyaa baateh ho skti hai agr apn deletion krteh hai from the hash-table and uske according phir apnko kya-kya baato ka dhyn rkhna hai and mtlb apnko phir additionally kuch krne ki jarurat hai etc..etc.. like that.)

// now yeh jo Quadratic-probing yeh Clusture-formation-Resolving method hai. jo ki Linear-Probing meh ho jata thaa... as half-of-space is wasted voh baat important nhi hai q ki half-of-space wasting toh chlti hai.
