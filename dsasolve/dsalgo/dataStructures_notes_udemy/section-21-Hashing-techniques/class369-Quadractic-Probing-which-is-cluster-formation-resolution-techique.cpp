//🔥💲🍕 Quadratic-Probing:- 🍕💲🔥
// To aviod clustering-of-elements in linear-probing this "quadratic-probing-is-introduced"
// As it is more same as linear-probing but bas farak is in formula that f(i) = i^2
//🖼️🖼️🖼️  see pic-1 :- to understading the "Quadractic-probing" 🖼️🖼️🖼️

// As toh quadratic-probing meh bas clustering nhi hogi... Or baki saab baateh apn as like linear-probing analyize kr sktehh hai..
