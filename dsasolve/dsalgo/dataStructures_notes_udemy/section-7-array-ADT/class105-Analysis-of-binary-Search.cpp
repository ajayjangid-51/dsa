//🔥💲🍕 AS now apn "Binary-Search" ko analysize krenge... 🍕💲🔥
// As toh analize krna mtlb gernerlize krna... and apn generalize krteh by simpy taking 2-3 cases on the example.

// as toh simpy ek example lenge and uski "tracing" krenge mtlb uspe "Binary-Search" perform krenge.. in the way that phle apn best-case k liyeh perform krenge , then phir second-best-case k liyeh perfom krenge and so..onn upto worst-case tk perform krenge.. as toh eske basis pe apn gernerlize kr payenge ki best-case-time-complexity kya hogi and worst-case-time-complexity kya hogi.
// 🔗🔗 as yeh kaam apnne "class105-pic" meh kr rkha hai.🔗🔗

// for both "Iterative and Recursive algorithm time-complexities are same only.."
//💲🍕 for Sucessful-Search 🍕💲
// 🍕 1.best-case-time of "binary-Search" is O(1)
// 🍕 2.and worst-case-time of "binary-Search" is O(logn) (or exactly it is ceil-value-of-log(n+1) with base-2 ) where n is number-of-elements in array-list.

//💲🍕 for UnSucessful-Search 🍕💲 (see class105-pic2 in which where square-box represent-the-unsuccefull-search-value)
// it is always(mtlb no-worst-case , no-best-case)  order-of-logn

// as now aage wali class meh apn "Average-case-time-Complexity dekhenge.."
