    // as now dono-choice meh hi kuch vulnerbility hai ki as agr apn first-choice krteh hai then vaha phir baad meh apnko har element check krna hoga ki element is empty or not-empty, as phir hi apn kuch aage kr payenge. and second-choice meh yeh hai ki agr yeh esseh krteh hai then vaha pe apn elements ko shift krna hoga, jismeh meh working toh hai hi. toh bas farak itna hai ki second-choice meh apn sara kaam phle haato-haat hi kr deteh hai jiski vagaj apna array bhi clean and clear mtlb confusion nhi rheta and first-choice meh apn as per need kaam krteh hai and vaha apnko khud ko bhi confusion rheta hai. thus toh overall apni second-choice sahi hai and apn yahi krteh hai.
